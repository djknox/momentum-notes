/** User Authentication **/
django has a built-in User model
request.user will return an AnonymousUser object if no user is logged in
can also just call user in templates, rather than request.user

user registration
third-party library - django registration redux
https://django-registration-redux.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
pipenv install django-registration-redux
add 'registration' to INSTALLED_APPS (above django.contrib.admin)
add ACCOUNT_ACTIVATION_DAYS to settings.py
migrate
add urls



template language has a for ... empty loop that will loop through an iterable or display something else if the iterable is empty
ex:
{% for athlete in athlete_list %}
    <li>{{ athlete.name }}</li>
{% empty %}
    <li>Sorry, no athletes in this list.</li>
{% endfor %}
