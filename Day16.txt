Django Tutorial Part 5: Creating our home page
url mappers forward the supported urls to their corresponding view functions
view functions get the requested data from the model and create html pages to return
templating language:
tags are enclosed in {% --> {% extends "base_generic.html" %}
variables are in handlebars --> {{ num_books }}
variable are passed into the template by the view function's render() function
referencing static files in templates --> {% load static %} and then {% static <path_to_static_resource> %}
default setting of STATIC_URL is '/static/'
linking to urls --> {% url <name_of_path_function_from_urls.py> %}
have to tell django to find the templates in the /templates directory by adding it to the TEMPLATES object in settings.py


Django Tutorial Part 6: Generic list and detail views
class-based views
in urls.py: use as_view() function - does all the work of creating an instance of the class and making sure that the right handler methods are called for incoming http requests
in views.py: create class that inherits from generic.ListView
in template: reference the list of objects with <class_name>_list --> book_list

can use if-statements and for-loops within templates --> {% if ... %}, {% for ... %}, etc.
access fields of variables with dot-notation --> {{ book.author }}

in url maps, can pass additional options in a dictionary as the third argument to path()
ex: path('url/', views.my_reused_view, {'my_template_name': 'some_path'}, name='aurl')
