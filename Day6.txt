/** Python - Day 2 **/
Functions
Recursion
Strings
Lists and tuples

functions
the string that is placed in the first line of a function is a docstring - tells what the function does and is put in documentation
ex:
def rectangle_area(width, height):
    """Given the width and height of a rectangle, return the area."""
    return width * height

print(rectangle_area(5, 8))

help(rectangle_area) will print out (amongst other details):
"Given the width and height of a rectangle, return the area."


recursion
functions can call themselves

# fib(n) = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
def fib(n):
    """Calculates the nth Fibonacci number, given that n is positive."""
    
    print("fib {}".format(n))
    if n < 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)

tuple
like a list, but immutable (cannot be changed after they are created)
tuples are defined with parentheses --> (5, 3, 4)

f-strings
way to interpolate values into text
first_name = "Keelan"
last_name = "Aho"
f"{first_name} {last_name}" --> 'Keelan Aho'




other:
big O notation
describes the complexity of an algorithm
O(N) - linear growth
O(N^2) - exponential growth
