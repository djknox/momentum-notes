Momentum - Cohort 5
Day 26 - Tuesday, July 2, 2019

/** ManyToMany Relationships **/

/** Aggregations **/
"On the detail page for a habit, show the best day for that habit, and the average day for that habit."
habit = Habit.objects.annotate(best_day=Max("daily_records__progress"))... --> now have habit.best_day
habit = Habit.objects.annotate(avg_day=Avg("daily_records__progress"))... --> now have habit.avg_day

aggregate() - will return a value calculated over an entire query set
annotate() - will add the value to each model instance in the query set


/** Calvin Spealman - Testing **/
fuzz testing - randomly generating test parameters
write tests based on goals, not on the code being tested
