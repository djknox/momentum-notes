/** Command Line / Terminal **/
Shell - currently using bash, takes in commands and gives back output
Prompt - where you type commands

Exiting Terminal Commands:
q
^c (ctrl + c)
^d (ctrl + d)
esc

Exit Vim:
:q!

tab - command line will try to auto-complete

Make and Remove Directories:
mkdir (make directory)
rmdir (remove empty directory)
rm -rf (remove directory and everything inside it)

Bash Profile
.bash_profile



/** Version Control with Git **/
Working Directory - code is checked out into, current version of code while it's developed (both tracked and untracked)
Staging Area - code changes that will be committed

git clone <url> - copy remote repo into local repo
git diff - see changes

Git Workflow:
1. git add
2. git commit
3. git push

Working Directory --> git add --> Staging Area --> git commit --> Local Repository --> git push --> Remote Repo


git commit -m 'add commit message here':
use present tense in commit messages

--help flag will provide man page/additional info on how to use command (ex: git add --help)

git pull - sync changes from remote repo into local repo
merge conflict - changes done to the same code, git will ask to resolve
forking - get local copy of remote repo for later creating a pull request to merge back into remote repo
