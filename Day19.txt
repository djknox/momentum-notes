/** Q&A **/
Can we run through tracing a URL and where it is all affected?
what pages need to have content in them for the url to show up etc...

When do we need to add an "id" attribute to a class like we did with the BookInstance class?
when you want to make a unique version of a primary key (otherwise, models.Model will automatically give your class an id attribute when you derive from it)

When do you make migration? After which changes? 
When you make a change to a model

Why are model names singular in their naming scheme?
a model represents a class - so an instance of a class (an object) will be singular

Are templates and forms the same - but one for front end and one for back end?
forms are objects that will be passed into templates by views
