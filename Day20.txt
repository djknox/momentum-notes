Group H

/** Models **/
Field.default - set the default value for a field

data migrations
python manage.py makemigrations --empty yourappname --> create empty migration to write

.objects - Object Manager
ex: Book.objects.all()
.get() - returns single instance if a single instance exists, or raises an Exception if it doesn't exist or there are multiple instances that exist --> Card.objects.get(pk=1)
.filter() - returns a query set (or empty query set if no matches) --> Card.objects.filter(times_correct=0)
.exclude() - opposite of filter()

traversing relationships:
<related_model>_set --> stack.card_set - card_set is all of stack's cards
same as Card.objects.filter(stack=stack) - filter Card objects that belong to stack
can change related_name argument when defining a relationship to change name (default related_name="<related_object>_set")

auto_now_add = True
auto_now --> automatically set the datetime whenever the object is saved --> good for last_modified fields
auto_now_add --> automatically set the datetime when the object is created --> good for created_at fields

field lookups
__ after field name being filtered on --> Entry.objects.get(id__exact=14)

field lookups that span relationships
__ after related object being filtered on --> Entry.objects.filter(blog__name='Beatles Blog')
