/** Responsive Design ** /
design for mobile - enhance for desktop

three parts:
flexible, grid-based layout
flexible images
media queries via css

making a flexible grid
use percentages for elements inside your container
include margins
for your grid container, consider px/rem for width and % for max-width

flexible images
img {
	max-width: 100%;
}

need in <head> to work well with mobile:
<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width">

media queries
@media print {}
@media screen and (max-width: 1024px) {} - if on a screen and screen is at most 1024px, use this css
use media queries sparingly

where to put break points in media queries
device screen sizes aren't future proof, but here are the current standards:
phones: < 768px
tablets: >= 768px
desktops: >= 992px
big desktops: >= 1200px
