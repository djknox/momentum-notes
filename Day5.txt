Momentum - Cohort 5
Day 5 - Monday, June 3, 2019

Group C Tuesday@1:00pm

/** Python **/
help() will give info on how to use a function
ex: help(print) will give info on how to use print()

integers, floats, booleans, strings
triple quotes for multi-line strings

converting between types - built-in functions
int("2") --> 2
float("5.5") --> 5.5
str(9) --> "9"
int("5.5") --> throws an error

any division will return a float (other than integer division with //)
6 / 3 --> 2.0
6 // 3 --> 2

printing to the screen
print()

getting input from user
input()
all user input is a string

variable names are in snake_case

whitespace matters - indent to group statements together in functions, conditionals, etc.

conditionals and loops
if statements
if age >= 21:
	print("You are an adult.")
	print("You are allowed to drink and vote.")
elif age >= 18:
	print("You are an adult.")
	print("You are allowed to vote but not drink.")
else:
	print("You are not allowed to drink or vote.")

while statements
i = 1
while i <= 10:
	print(i)
	i += 1

use 'and' and 'or' to combine predicates in conditionals
can use parentheses for grouping

run python apps with python3 app_name.py
ex: python3 book_cost.py
