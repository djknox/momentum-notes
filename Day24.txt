Momentum - Cohort 5
Day 24 - Friday, June 28, 2019
Group H

/** Amy Gori - Git **/
Using Git + GitHub with a Team
git log --oneline --> puts each commit message on one line

Production Branch --> Feature Branches
Production Branch --> Development Branch --> Feature Branches

setup:
1. one person creates the repo and adds others as collaborators
2. clone the repo so each collaborator has a local copy
3. create and work on feature branches
4. name each branch something descriptive of the work being done
5. discuss as a team how you will work together and communicate

GitHub-only concepts:
pull requests
forks

your workflow:
git pull origin master  --> make sure local master is up to date
git merge master --> merges your local master into the feature branch
git push origin feature-branch

commit often
pull often - so you will have your colleagues' work
push often - to keep your remote branch up to date
pull request - so team members can review your work
merge

merging strategy:
merge remote master to local master
merge master to feature branch
merge feature branch to master --> via a PR
