Goal 1: Habits
User creates a Habit:
	name = "1000 Steps Each Day"
	description = "I want to walk 1000 steps daily."
	target = 1000

User creates a DailyRecord for that Habit:
	day_number = 1
	date = July 1, 2019
	description = "I walked 1014 steps today."
	progress = 1014
	met_goal = daily_record.progress >= daily_record.habit.target --> True

User creates another DailyRecord for that Habit:
	day_number = 2
	date = July 2, 2019
	description = "I walked 513 steps today."
	progress = 513
	met_goal = daily_record.progress >= daily_record.habit.target --> False

Goal 2: Accountability
User can add Users to observe a Habit
User can see their own Habit(s) + Habit(s) of the users they are observing




Views:
User can view all their Habits --> '/' that redirects to '/habits/' - DJ
User can create a new Habit --> '/habits/create/' - DJ
User can view a specific Habit --> 'habits/<int:pk>/' -- Meagan
User can add a DailyRecord to a Habit --> '/habits/<int:pk>/new-record/' - DJ
User can edit a DailyRecord --> '/dailyrecords/<int:pk>/' -- Meagan
