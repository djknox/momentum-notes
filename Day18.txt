Django Tutorial Part 10: Testing a Django web application
Django has a test framework for automating unit tests, built on the unittest library
unit tests - verify functional behavior of individual components (usually class and function level)
regression tests - tests that reproduce bugs and verify that it has been fixed
integration tests - verify how groupings of containers work with each other
to write a test, derive a class from any of the Django test base classes
setUp() and tearDown() methods can be defined and will be run for each test execution
django.Test.TestCase will create a clean database before running tests and execute each test as a transaction
unittest will discover tests under the current working directory that start with test --> test_models.py
setUpTestData() - called once at the beginning of the test run
setUp() - called before every test function
python3 manage.py test - run all tests in directory
to validate view behavior, use the django.test.Client class to make requests
other testing tools:
coverage.py - reports on how much of your code is being tested 
selenium - framework to automate testing in a real browser
