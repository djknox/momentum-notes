Django + JavaScript - Part One

Static files will not be served normally when Django is DEBUG=False

returning JSON from a view function:
JsonResponse class
return JsonResponse()

why to keep javascript minimal:
- SEO (search engine indexing doesn't necessarily wait for JS to load)

request contains:
url
http verb
headers
body (optionally/if submitting a form/etc.)

response contains:
status code
headers
body
